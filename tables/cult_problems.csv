The leadership is insane in unhelpful ways
It caught the eye of a dangerous enemy
One of its servitor monsters is out of control
It’s running low on sacrifices and slaves
It’s been impoverished by a recent trouble
There’s a dangerous schism in its ranks
Its god is making unreasonable demands
The laity is demanding much from the priests
The enforcers are muscling their clerical lords
The god’s influence has become distant
An important member has turned traitor
Another dark faith is warring with it
