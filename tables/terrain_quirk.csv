It has significant magical structures in it
It has a place in the national origin legend
It is entirely man-made by ancient arts
Time and space sometimes slip there
The magical power there attracts wizards
It subtly changes those who live there
It’s holy land to a particular faith
It was formerly a different kind of terrain
It has human-worked vistas of beauty
It was formerly an Outsider stronghold
A significant part of it is subterranean
It’d expand were it not for ancient wards
It was a nature preserve of a megastructure
It’s maintained by an ancient artificial mind
Magic is somehow warped in its area
The flora and fauna are queasily “off”
The locals once populated it more heavily
Rulership of the feature is widely disputed
It’s riddled with caves and delvings
A unique type of sentient lives there
