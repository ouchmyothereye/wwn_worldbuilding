"Each holy man or woman is the autonomous leader of their own branch of the sect, with however many followers they can gather. "
"There are multiple pontiffs, friendly or otherwise, with subordinate clergy obedient to their own pontiff and perhaps cooperative with others. "
"There is a single pontiff with a layer of upper clergy and temple heads beneath them, who have a layer of minor clergy serving them. "
"Individual congregations are independent, with their clergy subject to the consensus will of their parishioners. "
"Powerful lay believers fund temples that are subject to their family’s wishes, staffed by clergy supported by their funding. "
"There is no official clergy; some believers may take up special roles or provide teaching, but they are not qualitatively different from others. "
"The church is entirely part of the secular structure of the land, its clergy no more than officials appointed by the government to their roles."
