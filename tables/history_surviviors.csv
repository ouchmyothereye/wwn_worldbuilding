They fled for refuge to a neighboring nation
They sought to hide in a dangerous wilderness
They were exterminated by bitter rivals
They degenerated into savage remnants
They were enslaved by their enemies
They were magically transformed or twisted
They were shattered into pockets of survivors
They became a remnant shadow of themselves
They forcibly migrated into a weaker land
They formed the nucleus of a new culture
"They split into several new, smaller groups"
Roll twice; the resultant groups hate each other
