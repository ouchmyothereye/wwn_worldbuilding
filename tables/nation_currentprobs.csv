Farmland is becoming worn-out and depleted
Verminous monsters are swarming
A rebel front is stirring up trouble
An outside power is backing internal strife
The leadership is inept and distracted
A religious reformer is breaking old compacts
An evil is provoking outraged rioting
Dark cults are attracting the ambitious
A Blighted horde is threatening the borders
An ancient ruin has disgorged some peril
Malcontents have obtained a potent artifact
Luxuriance has left the nation’s coffers bare
Local aristocrats are pushing for independence
An important mine has run out or been harmed
A sinister favorite has infatuated the leader
A recurring plant plague is causing hunger
Fearsome monsters are migrating into the land
A rival is preparing for war or raiding
A grand national plan is exhausting the people
A savage grudge has erupted between lords
