There were no other humans living here
They were wiped out in warfare
They were utterly assimilated
They were driven into exile
They became the ruling class
They became an oppressed underclass
They were partially assimilated
They retained small areas of self-rule
Roll 1d8 twice; both happened
No one can agree on what happened
