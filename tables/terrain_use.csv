A rare and precious resource is found there
Ancient sites and relics are common there
It’s sacred land to a group or religion
Controlling it has military significance
It has substantial productive infrastructure
A major trade route goes through it
"Uncontrolled, it’s a nest of raiders and worse"
A mighty Working is still functioning there
