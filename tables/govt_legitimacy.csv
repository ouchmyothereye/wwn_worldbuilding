They’ve simply always been the rulers
They’re thought wiser and more virtuous
Their martial prowess is awe-inspiring
The gods chose them as the leaders
They were chosen by popular will
They’re loved for their benevolence
They utterly crushed the last batch of rebels
They brought greater prosperity to the land
They smashed the prior government
They brought order out of bloody chaos
They led the nation to greater glory and pride
They seem less bad than the alternatives
