Their chief schemes too much against rivals
They’re out of touch or lazy in their work
They recently suffered a bloody purge
Enemy forces have allies among them
They’re distracted by factional infighting
The leadership tends to ignore their advice
They tacitly usurp power from the ruler
They’re committed to a very bad idea
