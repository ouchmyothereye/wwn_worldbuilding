Unbelievers are to be killed on principle
Hideous appetites of the flesh are sacred
Unholy entities from beyond must be called
Unbelievers are cattle to be used as desired
The world must die to make room for the god
Secular civilization must be destroyed
All law but the cult’s must be overthrown
The god demands a terrible nourishment
