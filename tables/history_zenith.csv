Its people were too deeply divided
Its leadership was hopelessly inept
The gods cursed it to ruin
Decadence and self-absorption doomed it
It was vastly overconfident in its plans
Its neighbors conspired to help ruin it
"It was actually two crises, and it was too much"
It was culturally exhausted and apathetic
Some tried to take advantage of the crisis
Its strengths were useless against the problem
The crisis was far too vast and overwhelming
Some leaders were allied with the crisis
