Aboriginal peoples united in the area
They were refugees from a fallen land
They were exiles or losers of some civil strife
They were colonists who became independent
They were magically created or shaped here
They all followed a faith or ideology here
They were a conquering army gone native
They migrated here for profit or plunder
