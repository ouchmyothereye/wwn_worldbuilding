A rival faith is doing the temple real harm
The locals expect a miracle it can’t provide
The leader is fighting with their superiors
A priest recently did something awful
The temple got into serious debt lately
Some disaster physically damaged the place
Some armed men have a grudge against it
The elite refuse to patronize it for some reason
It suffers signs of real divine displeasure
A sorcerer-priest is meddling with dark forces
A schismatic is drawing off its believers
Roll twice; one because of the other
