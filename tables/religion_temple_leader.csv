A venal time-server of desultory piety
A harried and inexperienced new leader
A dutiful minion of the local secular power
An incompetent shunted off to the post
A local prodigy of remarkable abilities
A grizzled and pragmatic leader
A charismatic but near-schismatic iconoclast
A practical and reasonably pious cleric
