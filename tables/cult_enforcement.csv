Magical curses scourge the disobedient
Blackmail and threats of social ruin
Murder by cult enforcers and monsters
Mental compulsions implanted by rituals
Kidnapping before a hideous ritual death
Traitors are betrayed to cult enemies
Violence against a traitor’s loved ones
The dark god’s divine wrath smites them
Control of an addictive thing they need
Lay believers gain glory by purging traitors
